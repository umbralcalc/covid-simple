A very simple stochastic simulation for COVID-19 transmission based on [Anderson et al. (2020)](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(20\)30567-5/fulltext).

This software has also been used to inform a Royal Society rapid review publication on estimating the basic reproduction number. This report can be found here: [https://royalsociety.org/news/2020/09/set-c-covid-r-rate/](https://royalsociety.org/news/2020/09/set-c-covid-r-rate/).
